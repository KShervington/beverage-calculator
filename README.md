# twyst-drink-calculator
A tool that allows users to calculate how many drinks will be needed for their event, based on event duration and number of guests.

> ## Creator's Note:
> 
> This tool was integrated into the client's Squarespace website as a code block.
> That is reason all the styling, HTML, and Javascript are in one file.
> That being said, this drink calculator will still be fully functional when launched
> independently, though it will look different than it does on the client's website.
